# Getting Started

Getting started is one command away:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/REPO/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
ai-chat "Hello"
```

The script prompts for your API key, installs the binary to `/usr/local/bin` and writes the key to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ai-chat/ai-chat.yaml`.

The script prompts for your API key and writes it to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ai-chat/ai-chat.yaml`.

Use `/help` inside the chat for more commands.

That's it! You can now start asking questions straight from your terminal.
