# Getting Started

Follow these steps to get up and running quickly:

1. **Install the binary** from the [releases page](https://github.com/jalsarraf0/ai-chat-cli/releases) or run `./setup.sh` after cloning the repo.
2. **Export your API key** once:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
   ```
3. **Start chatting** interactively:
   ```bash
   ai-chat
   ```
4. Use `/help` inside the chat for available commands.

That's it! You can now start asking questions straight from your terminal.
